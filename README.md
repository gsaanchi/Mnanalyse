In the MnAnalyse Case Study Competition (August 2024) by the Finance and Economics Club of IIT Guwahati, the focus was a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis of WhatsApp’s valuation during Meta's 2014 acquisition for $19 billion. The analysis involved projecting WhatsApp’s future cash flows based on user growth, engagement, and potential monetization strategies like advertising and subscriptions. These were discounted using Meta’s cost of capital to determine the intrinsic value.

The case study also examined the strategic rationale behind the acquisition, which went beyond immediate financial returns. Meta saw WhatsApp’s vast user base as essential for securing its position in the messaging space, especially in emerging markets. By integrating WhatsApp with its existing platforms like Facebook and Instagram, Meta aimed to strengthen its ecosystem and avoid competition. The analysis highlighted how strategic factors like user base expansion and long-term integration justified the high valuation despite WhatsApp's minimal direct revenue at the time.
